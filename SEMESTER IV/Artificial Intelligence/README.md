# Artificial Intelligence Course Laboratories

## Note

For all laboratories, templates were provided which outline most of the projects.
In each laboratory I was given the task to learn given topic and make some modification to the code.
In some cases the modifications were extensive, in others not so much.

This is part of my Studies repository, but I find it the most fascinating and want to highlight it.
